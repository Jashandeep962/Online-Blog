## Day 1  
In the 1st week of my Training in java at north pole web service. We started with core java. We were told about history evolution of java its basic feature.  Java orignaly called OAK , and was designed for handheld dwvices and set top boxes, OAK was unsuccsesfull so in 1995 sun changes the name JAVA and modified language. Java is an object oriented language similer to c++ , but simplified to eliminate language feature that cause common programming error.
 
## Day 2

- Given berif introduction of JDK,API and Package in java . 
- C++ concept were brused up and tested like polymorphism ,encapsulation ,,inheritance, abstraction ,classes ,objects etc.

## Day 3

- Taught basic syntax of java . I made program of “hello world “.
- Taught about variables in java – data types. When we declare variable we need to specify type of value it hold along with name.
- Practised variables on programs.

## Day 4

- Conditional statements of java coverd {if –then – else etc. }
- Conditional statement tells program what to do program verify statement according to tur or false value. then  practiced 

## Day 5

- Summing up , revice , practice various programs.

**Week 2 : 7 February to 11 February**

## Day 1: switch case statements
In this week tought about switch statement these statements unlike if- then have number of possible execution paths .

## Day 2: looping
When we want to execute any block of code number of times it is done by looping. Three loops :-

- While loop
- Do while loop 
- FOR loop
We were tought about while and do while loop

## Day 3: looping cont

- FOR loop :- it is use full when you know how many time dose the task is reapeated
- Syntax and practice and program on that.
  
## Day 4: constructor

Talk about constructor how to create it dose it implicit when we create class or not its syntacx or declaration and practice on previously studied programs

## Day 5: meathod overloading and constructor overloading

In java it is possible to define two ore more meathods within the same class that share same name as long as parameters where different .
Constructor overloading :- like meathod constroctor are also overload provided they should have different arguments because JVM diffrenciate constructor on
basis of argument passed in constructor . whenever we assign name of method same  as class name without any return type we called constructor overloading.

**Week 3 : 14 February to 18 February **

- I was assigned an mini project in which different  items are to be included and were to be sold and calculate profit and loss and also generate total invoice of inventory of item which are left. I made it using switch state ment  , looping statements etc. and learn how to use these statements.
- In last 2 days of week we learn about the concept of inheritance . inheritance means take something which is aleredy made. Throught this we can drive class called child class form parent class 

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

 **Week 4 : 21 feb to 25feb**
## Day1: Array
Then we taught about array. Array is group of contigus data that shares a common name.

## Day2 : array cont
We made different set of programs using array, some them about how to sart an array matrix addition subtractions of thos matrix.

## Day 3 : strings 

- Taght about strings in java. Learn string manipulations , learn about string related functions. 
- Like changing strings , replacing part or whole of string with another set of characters , how to display it and comparision of strings

## Day 4: Interface  
Learn interface how to use interface in java by making various java programs an interface is group of related methods with empty body. Interface can not be initiated it can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interface.

**Week 5 : 28 feb to 4 March**

In this week we learn how to make packages in java according to our need and to import these pacage in program . we also learn about error and exaption handling . learn about different type of exacptions and try , catch and throw statements
Then we tought about Applets , Applets are use to provide interactive feature to web applications that cannot be provided byb HTML alone. Can provide graphic content and run on web browser, start() , stop(), paint(),destroy() are some meathod of it.
Then taught about component of applet like button ,  radio button , cheack box , text field lable etc.
Then event handling . event handling done throught awt(abstract window toolkit ) pacage in java . in java event repersnt ale activity that gose between the user and the application . when user interact with program system creates an event representing the action 

**WEEK 6 :From7March to 11 March**

This week practiced event handling by making various programs.
Then I complete assignment which are given to me about making a form by using various components .
Then we taught about multithreading in java multithread contain two or more parts that can run concurrently (thread) 
Then swings in java , swing built on foundation of AWT. Swing tool kit include rich set of componts for building GUI and java applications – all  coding is done by cliking on source tab (netbeans)


**WEEK 7:- 14march to 18 march**

Then we taught about database management . we brifly introduce with SQL(structured query language) server .  we were taught  about how to handle or manipulate data in SQL database contain one or more tab handle query insert delet show etc.
Also taught about database connectivity, given code to connect our GUI made in JAVA with the tables made in our backend i.e. SQL server, made several basic program to check the user name and password stord in tables if they matched with the stored one success tab showed.


**WEEK 8:- 21march to 25 march **

In this week some more database concept were to be coverd , like foreign key it is the key in one table  which identify row in another table it use to establish ink in other ways.
